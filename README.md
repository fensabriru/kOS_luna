# kOS_luna
KSP - kOS navigation program for RSS/RO/RP0(dev) to hit Moon (1954).

starting with kOS and this is my first learning automation for early rocket to flyby/hit moon. It's based on kOS library
scripts for which i am giving credits :) 

Install notes:
copy boot_luna.ks to yours scripts/boot/ dir
rest to scripts folder.

If you have troubles open Luna rocket then try to build something similar and as boot file use boot_luna.ks
