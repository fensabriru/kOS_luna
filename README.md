# kOS_luna
KSP - kOS navigation program for RSS/RO/RP0(dev) to hit Moon (1954).

starting with kOS and this is my first learning automation for early rocket to flyby/hit moon. It's based on Desdinova721
 scripts and kOS library scripts for which i am giving credits :) 

Install notes:
copy boot_luna.ks to yours scripts/boot/ dir
rest to scripts folder.

If you have troubles open Luna rocket then try to build something similar and as boot file use boot_luna.ks

Launch script has been updated to support launch to specific orbits (inclination, apoapsis, periapsis, launch to selected plane and ability to burn all fuel if needed). I uploaded two launch example scripts : orbit.ks and orbit_rande.ks.
